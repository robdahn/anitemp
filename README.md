Template files to process structural magnetic resonance images from primates in CAT12/SPM12. The templates include T1 and T2 registration templates, a tissue probability map (TPM) for segmentation, a brain mask, and a Dartel registration template (Template 1-6).  The templates based on the Rilling's dataset (Rilling & Insel, 1999) created by Robert Dahnke for structural preprocessing in CAT12/SPM12.  The greate ape template consist of 12 images from chimpanzee, bonobos, orang-utan, and gorillas.  For further description see (Franke et al., 2017).
